# and Angular frontend project.

# If you still have a 'packages/' folder (e.g., older style or global packages cache), uncomment:
# packages/

# Test results
TestResults/

# Resharper / DotSettings files
*.DotSettings
*.userprefs

# ASP.NET Core specific
appsettings.Development.json # Often contains local sensitive info
appsettings.Production.json
appsettings.*.json # More generic for other environments
Properties/launchSettings.json # Local launch profiles, not for source control

# Generated files for Entity Framework Core migrations
# If you commit migrations, you might want to uncomment a specific folder
# for the generated snapshot or context model
# Example: If your migrations are in 'Data/Migrations/' and you want to ignore snapshots:
# Data/Migrations/*.Designer.cs
# Data/Migrations/*_ContextModelSnapshot.cs
# Note: Usually you *do* commit migration files unless they are temporary.

# User secrets (handled by the .NET CLI, stored outside repo by default, but good to double check)
# It's typically located in %APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<UserSecretsId>\secrets.json
# so it won't be in your repo anyway, but if it accidentally got created locally:
secrets.json

# Local database files
*.mdf
*.ldf
*.sdf
*.db

# =====================================================================
# Angular / Node.js / Frontend specific ignores

node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.npm/

# Build artifacts for Angular (usually inside the Angular project folder, e.g., 'ClientApp/dist/')
# You'll need to adjust this path based on where your Angular project is relative to the .gitignore.
# Assuming your Angular project is in a subfolder like 'ClientApp' or 'AngularApp':
ClientApp/dist/ # Common build output folder for Angular
AngularApp/dist/ # Another common example
*/dist/          # A more generic pattern if you have multiple frontend apps in subfolders

# Angular Cache
.angular/cache/

# Cypress/Protractor (E2E testing)
cypress/videos/
cypress/screenshots/
